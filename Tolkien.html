The <em>Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy, alongside <em>The Hobbit</em>, is probably the best-known work of J.R.R. Tolkien.
This epic high-fantasy series of Tolkien's was created between 1937 and 1945. One of the best seeling novels
ever written, the trilogy has sold 150 million copies since its creation.

<p>

The character in the title of the trilogy refers to the story's main antagonist, the Dark Lord Sauron,
who created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power as the ultimate weapon
in his campaign to conquer and rule all of Middle-Earth, the fantasy world in which the story takes place.
The story begins from the beautifully quiet English-countryside-like land of the Shire,
from which a hobbit (the inhabitants of the Shire) by the name of Frodo Baggins treks across Middle-earth in
an effort to destroy the One Ring, with the help of his companions, including fellow hobbit Samwise Gamgee.

<p>

Structurally, the three volumes are titled <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>, <em>The Two Towers</em>, and <em>The Return of the King</em>.
There are three main groups of creatures in the world of Middle Earth: Men, Elves, and Dwarves.
Other key characterson Frodo's journey include the Men Aragorn son of Arathorn, a Ranger of the North,
and Boromir, a Captain of Gondor; Gimli son of Gl&oacutein, a Dwarf warrior;
Legolas Greenleaf, an Elven prince; and Gandalf, a Wizard.

    The first book in the trilogy is <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>.
    The story begins in the Shire,
    where the hobbit Frodo Baggins inherits the Ring from Bilbo Baggins,
    his cousin and guardian. Neither hobbit is aware of the Ring's nature,
    but Gandalf the Grey, a wizard and an old friend of Bilbo,
    suspects it to be Sauron's Ring.
    After Gandalf confirms his suspicions,
    he tells Frodo the history of the Ring and counsels him to take the Ring away from the Shire.
    Frodo leaves the Shire, in the company of his gardener and friend, Samwise ("Sam") Gamgee,
    and two cousins, Meriadoc Brandybuck, called Merry, and Peregrin Took, called Pippin.
    On their journey, they meet a Ranger named Strider, who is mentioned in a letter from Gandalf.
    Strider persuades the hobbits to take him on as their guide and protector.
    Together, they leave Bree after another close escape from the Black Riders.
    On the hill of Weathertop, they are again attacked by the Black Riders,
    who wound Frodo with a cursed blade. Strider fights off the Black Riders with fire and
    leads the hobbits towards the Elven refuge of Rivendell.
    Frodo falls deathly sick from the wound.
    <p>
    The Black Riders nearly overtake Frodo at the Ford of Bruinen,
    but flood waters summoned by Elrond, master of Rivendell, rise up and overwhelm them.
    Frodo recovers in Rivendell under the care of Elrond.
    The Council of Elrond speaks of the history of Sauron and the Ring.
    Strider is revealed to be Aragorn, the heir of Isildur.
    Gandalf reveals that Sauron has corrupted Saruman, chief of the wizards.
    The Council decides that the Ring must be destroyed, but that can only be done by sending it to the
    Fire of Mount Doom in Mordor, where it was forged.
    Frodo takes this task upon himself. Elrond, with the advice of Gandalf, chooses companions for him.
    The Company of the Ring are nine in number:
    Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gandalf, Gimli the Dwarf, Legolas the Elf, and the Man Boromir,
    son of the Ruling Steward Denethor of the land of Gondor. <p>
    On their journey, the Company is forced to try a dangerous path through the Mines of Moria.
    After surviving an attack, they are pursued by orcs and by an ancient demon called a Balrog.
    Gandalf faces the Balrog, and both of them fall into the abyss.
    The others escape and find refuge in the Elven forest of Lothl&oacuterien,
    where they are counselled by Galadriel and Celeborn.
    With boats and gifts from Galadriel, the Company travel down the River Anduin to the hill of
    Amon Hen. Boromir tries to take the Ring from Frodo, but Frodo puts on the Ring and disappears.
    The Company is scattered in the panic to find Frodo, and they are attacked by Orcs.
    Frodo chooses to go alone to Mordor. Sam guesses Frodo's mind, and goes with him.

    The second book in the trilogy is <em>The Two Towers</em>.
    Orcs sent by Saruman and Sauron kill Boromir and take Merry and Pippin.
    Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas debate amongst themselves which pair of hobbits to follow.
    They decide to follow the Orcs bearing Merry and Pippin to Saruman.
    In the kingdom of Rohan, the Orcs are slain by a company of the Rohirrim.
    Merry and Pippin escape into Fangorn Forest, where they are befriended by Treebeard,
    the oldest of the tree-like Ents. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas track the hobbits to Fangorn.
    There they unexpectedly meet Gandalf. Gandalf explains that he slew the Balrog; darkness took him,
    but he was sent back (to Middle-earth).
    He is clothed in white and is now "Gandalf the White",
    for he has taken Saruman's place as the chief of the wizards.
    Gandalf assures his friends that Merry and Pippin are safe.
    Together they ride to Edoras, capital of Rohan. <p>

    Gandalf frees Th&eacuteoden, King of Rohan,
    from the influence of Saruman's spy Gr&iacutema Wormtongue.
    Th&eacuteoden musters his fighting strength and rides with his men to the ancient fortress of Helm's Deep,
    while Gandalf departs to seek help from Treebeard.
    Meanwhile, the Ents, roused by Merry and Pippin from their peaceful ways,
    attack Isengard, Saruman's stronghold, and trap the wizard in the tower of Orthanc.
    Gandalf convinces Treebeard to send an army of Huorns to Th&eacuteoden's aid.
    Gandalf brings an army of Rohirrim to Helm's Deep, and they defeat the Orcs,
    who flee into the waiting shadow of the trees. Gandalf visits Saruman,
    offering him a chance to turn away from evil. When Saruman refuses to listen,
    Gandalf strips him of his rank and most of his powers. Pippin picks up a palantír,
    a seeing-stone that Saruman used to speak with Sauron and through which Saruman was ensnared, and is seen by Sauron.
    Gandalf rides for Minas Tirith, chief city of Gondor, taking Pippin with him.

    <p>Frodo and Sam capture Gollum,
    who had been following them from Moria. They force him to guide them to Mordor.
    They find that the Black Gate of Mordor is too well guarded, so instead they travel to a secret way Gollum knows.
    On the way, they encounter Faramir, who, unlike his brother Boromir, resists the temptation to seize the Ring.
    He provides Frodo and Sam with food. Gollum — who is torn between his loyalty to Frodo and his desire for the Ring —
    betrays Frodo by leading him to the great spider Shelob in the tunnels of Cirith Ungol.
    Frodo falls when pierced by Shelob's sting. But with the help of Galadriel's gifts,
    Sam fights off the spider. Believing Frodo to be dead, Sam takes the Ring in the hope of finishing the quest alone.
    Orcs find Frodo, and from their words Sam becomes aware that Frodo is yet alive.
    The Orcs take Frodo's body, and Sam chases after them, entering Mordor alone.

        The third book in the trilogy is <em>The Return of the King</em>.
        Sauron sends a great army against Gondor. Gandalf arrives at Minas Tirith to warn Denethor of the attack,
        while Th&eacuteoden leads the Rohirrim to the aid of Gondor.
        Minas Tirith is besieged. Denethor is deceived by Sauron and falls into despair.
        He burns himself alive on a pyre, nearly taking his son Faramir with him.

      <p>Aragorn, accompanied by Legolas, Gimli and the Rangers of the North,
        takes the Paths of the Dead in the hopes of bringing the Dead to his aid,
        for the Dead Men of Dunharrow are bound by a curse by which they are given no rest until they fulfil their oath to fight for the King of Gondor.
        With the coming of Aragorn, the Army of the Dead fulfil their oath and strike terror into the Corsairs of Umbar invading southern Gondor.
        Aragorn defeats the Corsairs and takes their ships,
        which he uses to bring the men of southern Gondor up the Anduin,
        coming just in time to the aid of Minas Tirith.
        &Eacuteowyn, Th&eacuteoden's niece whom he loves as a daughter,
        slays the Lord of the Nazgûl with help from Merry.
        Th&eacuteoden is slain and Éowyn and Merry are injured.
        Together Gondor and Rohan defeat Sauron's army in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.

    <p>Meanwhile, Sam rescues Frodo from the tower of Cirith Ungol.
      They set out across Mordor.
      Aragorn leads an army of men from Gondor and Rohan to march on the Black Gate of Mordor,
      so as to distract Sauron from his true danger.
      His army is vastly outnumbered by the great might of Sauron.
      Frodo and Sam reach the edge of the Cracks of Doom,
      but Frodo cannot resist the Ring any longer.
      Frodo claims the Ring for himself and puts it on his finger.
      Gollum suddenly reappears, having caught up with the hobbits.
      He struggles with Frodo and bites off Frodo's finger with the Ring on it.
      Celebrating wildly, Gollum loses his footing and falls into the Fire,
      taking the Ring with him. The Ring is destroyed,
      and Sauron loses his power forever.
      The Nazgul perish, and Sauron's armies are thrown into such disarray that Aragorn's forces emerge victorious.

    <p>Aragorn is crowned Elessar, King of Arnor and Gondor,
      and weds Arwen, daughter of Elrond.
      The four hobbits make their way back to the Shire,
      only to find out that the Shire has been enslaved by bad men.
      The hobbits raise a rebellion and overthrow the men, who turn out to be led by Saruman.
      Frodo does not allow the hobbits to kill Saruman,
      but Gr&iacutema turns on Saruman and kills him in front of Bag End (Frodo's hobbit-hole).
      He is slain in turn by hobbit archers, and the War of the Ring comes to its true end on Frodo's
      very doorstep.

    <p>Merry and Pippin are celebrated as heroes.
      Sam marries Rosie Cotton and uses his gifts from Galadriel to help heal the Shire.
      But Frodo is still wounded in body and spirit, having borne the Ring for so long.

    <p>A few years later, in the company of Bilbo and Gandalf,
      Frodo sails from the Grey Havens west over the Sea to the Undying Lands to find peace.

    <p>In the appendices,
      Sam gives his daughter Elanor the Red Book of Westmarch,
      which contains the story of Bilbo's adventures and the War of the Ring as told by the hobbits.
      Sam is then said to have crossed west over the Sea himself, the last of the Ring-bearers.

<h1 id="The Hobbit"><em>The Hobbit</em></h1>
<p>

<img src="http://static.srcdn.com/slir/w570-h300-q90-c570:300/wp-content/uploads/the-hobbit-movies.jpg" alt="Hobbit" width="55%" align="right">

<em>The Hobbit</em>, or <em>There and Back Again</em> is a children's fantasy novel by English author J. R. R. Tolkien.
It was published on 21 September 1937 to wide critical acclaim, being nominated for the Carnegie Medal and awarded a prize from the New York Herald Tribune for best juvenile fiction. The book remains popular and is recognized as a classic in children's literature.
<p><em>The Hobbit</em> is set in a time "between the Dawn of Færie and the Dominion of Men",and follows the quest of home-loving hobbit Bilbo Baggins to win a share of the treasure guarded by Smaug the dragon. Bilbo's journey takes him from light-hearted, rural surroundings into more sinister territory.
<p>The story is told in the form of an episodic quest,
  and most chapters introduce a specific creature or type of creature of Tolkien's geography. Bilbo gains a new level of maturity, competence, and wisdom by accepting the disreputable, romantic, fey, and adventurous sides of his nature and applying his wits and common sense. The story reaches its climax in the Battle of the Five Armies, where many of the characters and creatures from earlier chapters re-emerge to engage in conflict.
  <p>Personal growth and forms of heroism are central themes of the story, along with motifs of warfare. These themes have led critics to view Tolkien's own experiences during World War I as instrumental in shaping the story. The author's scholarly knowledge of Germanic philology and interest in fairy tales are often noted as influences.
  <p> The publisher was encouraged by the book's critical and financial success and, therefore, requested a sequel. As Tolkien's work progressed on the successor The Lord of the Rings, he made retrospective accommodations for it in <em>The Hobbit</em>. These few but significant changes were integrated into the second edition. Further editions followed with minor emendations, including those reflecting Tolkien's changing concept of the world into which Bilbo stumbled.
  <p>  The work has never been out of print. Its ongoing legacy encompasses many adaptations for stage, screen, radio, board games, and video games. Several of these adaptations have received critical recognition on their own merits.
